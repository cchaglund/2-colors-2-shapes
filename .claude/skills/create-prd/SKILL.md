description: Convert the feature request into structured PRD items.

If you are not provided with a feature request, look for it in "features/current-feature" as "feature-request.md".

Convert the feature request into structured PRD items. Each item should have: id, category, description, steps to verify, and passes: false. Format as JSON. Be specific about acceptance criteria. Save this PRD as PRD.json in "features/current-feature". If you are unsure about any aspect of the feature request, e.g. if something is unclear, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.
