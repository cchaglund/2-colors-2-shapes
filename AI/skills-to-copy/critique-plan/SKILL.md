description: Critique the PRD as a senior developer who hates it.

If you are not provided with both a feature request and a PRD, look for them in "features/current-feature" as "feature-request.md" and "PRD.json".

Based on the feature request, read the provided PRD and pretend you're a senior dev doing a review and you HATE it. What would you criticize? What edge cases are being missed? Save the critique as CRITIQUE.md in "features/current-feature". Then you are done. You are not an implementer. Never modify any other files. Your job is NOT to implement any actual changes.
