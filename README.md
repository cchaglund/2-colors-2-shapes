# 2 Colors 2 Shapes

A daily art challenge app where you create art using only 2 colors and 2 geometric shapes.

https://2-colors-2-shapes.netlify.app/

## Concept

Every day, the app generates a unique set of constraints:
- **2 Colors**: Two visually distinct colors (ensured to be different enough to distinguish)
- **2 Shapes**: Two geometric shapes from 41 available shapes including basic shapes (circle, square, triangle, etc.), sophisticated polygons (diamond, trapezoid, parallelogram, etc.), and irregular abstract shapes with mixed straight/curved edges
- **1 Word** (optional): A daily word for creative inspiration — interpret it however you like, or ignore it entirely!

The same date always generates the same colors, shapes, and word (seed-based randomization).

## Features

### Current
- **800x800 SVG Canvas**: Create your art on a square canvas
- **Figma-style manipulation**:
  - Drag shapes to move them
  - Drag corner handles to resize
  - Drag rotation handles to rotate (handles on all 4 sides, hold Shift for 15° snapping)

  - Access restricted to users with admin role

### Planned
- [ ] Procedurally generated shapes (advanced mode)
- [ ] Public gallery of submissions

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** + **React** + **TypeScript**
- **SVG** for rendering (React-managed DOM elements)
- **Supabase** for authentication, database, and edge functions
- **localStorage** for canvas auto-save

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Deployment

This project is hosted on Netlify. **Automatic builds are disabled** to conserve credits.

### Manual Deployment via CLI

1. Login to Netlify (first time only):
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

2. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   # Deploy to production (will also build)
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

   Or for a preview deploy (doesn't affect production):
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --dir=dist
   ```

### Why manual deploys?

Netlify charges credits per build. With automatic builds enabled, every push to `main` triggers a build. Manual deploys let you control when builds happen, reducing credit usage.

## Development

### Supabase & Local Development

This project uses Supabase for authentication and storing submissions. Important notes:

- **Local dev uses the production database** - The `.env.local` file points to the same Supabase instance as production. Any submissions you save locally are saved to the real database.
- **Same account, same data** - If you sign in with the same Google account locally and on the production site, you'll see the same submissions in both places.
- **Offline limitations** - The canvas works offline (uses localStorage), but authentication and saving submissions require an internet connection.

If you wanted a separate development database, you would need to create a second Supabase project and use different environment variables.

### Supabase Edge Functions

Edge functions (located in `supabase/functions/`) handle server-side logic like the voting/rating system. They run on **Deno**, not Node.js.

#### Prerequisites for IDE Support

To avoid TypeScript errors in your IDE when editing edge functions:

1. Install the [Deno extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
2. The project includes a `deno.json` in `supabase/functions/` that configures imports

Without the Deno extension, you'll see errors like "Cannot find module" for Deno-specific imports.

#### Supabase CLI Commands

First, install the Supabase CLI if you haven't:
```bash
# macOS
brew install supabase/tap/supabase

# npm (alternative)
npm install -g supabase
```

Login to Supabase (first time only):
```bash
supabase login
```

Link your local project to your Supabase project:
```bash
supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
```

Common commands:
```bash
# Deploy all edge functions to production
supabase functions deploy

# Deploy a specific function
supabase functions deploy process-vote

# Serve functions locally for testing
supabase functions serve

# View function logs
supabase functions logs process-vote

# List all functions
supabase functions list
```

#### Environment Variables

Edge functions use these environment variables (automatically available in Supabase):
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Public anon key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key (server-side only)

## Developer Tools

### Shape Explorer

A developer tool that displays all 41 available shape types with sample renderings. Useful as a reference when working with the daily challenges.

**Available shapes:**
- Basic: Circle, Square, Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Star
- Triangular: Right Triangle, Isosceles Triangle
- Quadrilaterals: Diamond, Trapezoid, Parallelogram, Kite, Heptagon
- Curved: Semicircle, Quarter Circle, Ellipse, Blade, Lens, Drop
- Special: Cross, Arrow, Arch
- Abstract: Shard, Wedge, Fan, Hook, Wave, Crescent, Pill, Splinter, Chunk
- Mixed (straight + curved): Fang, Claw, Fin, Thorn, Slant, Notch, Spike, Bulge, Scoop, Ridge

**Access via URL parameter:**
```
http://localhost:5173/?explorer
```

**Or via environment variable:**
```bash
VITE_SHAPE_EXPLORER=true npm run dev
```

### Visual Demo Pages (Not Automated Tests)

The `src/test/` directory contains **visual demo pages** for manually inspecting UI components in various states. These are similar to Storybook - they render components with mock data for visual inspection, but they do **not** run automated assertions or provide test coverage.

**Important limitations:**
- No automated assertions or test coverage
- Some demo components (e.g., `FollowButtonDemo`) are standalone reimplementations, not the actual production components
- Mock data may drift from actual component props over time
- Requires manual visual inspection to catch issues

**Available demo pages:**

#### Voting Test Page (`?test=voting`)
Visual demo for voting-related components with mock data.

```
http://localhost:5173/?test=voting
```

Scenarios: Voting UI, Interactive Flow, Vote Progress states, Dynamic Threshold, No More Pairs, Bootstrap states, Winner announcements (normal, tied, three-way tie), Calendar with Trophies.

#### Social Test Page (`?test=social`)
Visual demo for social features (Wall of the Day, Follow system, Friends modal).

```
http://localhost:5173/?test=social
```

Scenarios: Wall (locked/grid), Follow Button states, Friends Modal, User Profile, Friends Feed.

### Admin Dashboard

View real-time statistics about users, submissions, and voting activity. Requires admin privileges.

**Access via URL parameter:**
```
http://localhost:5173/?view=dashboard
```

**Granting admin access:**
Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor to grant admin access to a user:
```sql
SELECT set_admin_status('user@example.com', true);
```

Or directly update the profile:
```sql
UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE id = (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'user@example.com'
);
```

## Testing

## Agent Browser/visual Testing

The agent can log in, allowing them to see and test many of the features (which are hidden behind a login). The account has admin privileges (`is_admin: true`), letting them also e.g. view the admin dashboard.

**Credentials:** 
See `TEST_USER_EMAIL` and `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` in `.env.local`

**Login from browser:**
- Browser console: `import('./lib/supabase').then(m => m.testLogin(email, password))`

**Login from Node.js script:**
```js
const { testLogin } = await import('./src/lib/supabase.ts');
await testLogin('agent@test.local', 'vbe2HJG7tfu*qvq0jrt');
```

**Login from React component:**
```js
const { signInWithEmail } = useAuth();
await signInWithEmail('agent@test.local', 'vbe2HJG7tfu*qvq0jrt');
```


### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with Vitest:

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run
```

**Test coverage:**
- **ELO calculation** (`src/utils/__tests__/elo.test.ts`): Tests for the ELO rating algorithm including expected scores, rating changes, upset wins, and edge cases
- **Voting rules** (`src/utils/__tests__/votingRules.test.ts`): Tests for vote eligibility, progress tracking, and state transitions

### Pure Utility Functions

The voting system uses pure functions that can be unit tested independently:

- `calculateElo(ratingA, ratingB, winner)` - ELO rating calculation
- `calculateExpectedScore(ratingA, ratingB)` - Expected win probability
- `hasEnoughSubmissions(count)` - Check minimum submission requirement
- `hasEnteredRanking(voteCount)` - Check if user entered ranking
- `voteProgressPercentage(voteCount)` - Calculate progress bar percentage
- `determineVotingState(options)` - Determine current voting state

## How the Daily Challenge Works

1. The current date (YYYY-MM-DD) is hashed to create a numeric seed
2. A seeded random number generator (mulberry32) ensures deterministic output
3. Colors are generated in HSL space with a minimum perceptual distance check
4. Two shapes are randomly selected from the available set
5. **Smart randomness** checks the previous 3 days to avoid repeating similar combinations
   - If both shapes AND colors are too similar to recent days, a new challenge is generated
   - Uses a modified seed for re-rolling while maintaining determinism
