# To-Do List

- forms for submitting feedback, reporting bugs, requesting features
- search for artist by email (hm, privacy implications?)
- should be able to comment on submissions from the "single submission page" (maybe a nightmare?)
~~- select multiple shapes by dragging a box around them with the mouse~~
- ~~buy domain and set up hosting~~ ✅ 2colors2shapes.com (Loopia + Netlify DNS)
~~- an "eye" icon on the layers panel to toggle visibility of each layer~~
~~- when hovering over a layer in the layers panel, highlight the corresponding shape on the canvas to make it easier to identify which layer corresponds to which shape~~
~~- in the "see what others have made" modal, actually show some of the submissions as a tease.~~

# Bugs
~~- no dark mode on the gallery pages?~~
~~- when you click on the wall, then a single submission page, then click back, now it says "you need to submit to see the wall" even though I have submitted.~~
~~- if i have a layer in a group and i duplicate it, then entire group moves to the top of the layer stack - bug! It should just duplicate the layer within the same group and not move the group at all.~~
- i have three groups. the bottommost group, if I click the single up arrow, it moves all the way to the top of the stack.

- test a bunch of manipulations (scaling, rotating, moving around) to see if the outline updates correctly in all cases.
- verify that when dragging layers in and out of groups, the layer panel UI updates correctly to reflect the new location of the layer after dragging.
- make sure voting works properly
- moving shapes with arrow buttons seems to be jumping too much, should be 1px per press
- when holding two fingers on trackpad and moving them you should pan the canvas (right now it's just scrolling the page)
