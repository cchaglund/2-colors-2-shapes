<!-- - show the actual shapes in the single submission view, not just the name of them. -->
<!-- - in the single submission view there should be buttons to go to next/previous submission without going back to the list. -->
- when clicking on a single submission from the list view it should NOT open in a new tab, just navigate in the same tab.
- if i got a trophy for a challenge's submission I should get a congratulations message/modal when I load/log in for that day (today I see the challenge's winners, but it's possible to miss that I won, I have to check the list to see if I won. It should be more obvious).
- calendar view should show the colors and shapes for each day, to see it quickly at a glance.
- some shape's outlines seems to have a lot of spacing between their outline and the shape itself. 
- test a bunch of manipulations (scaling, rotating, moving around) to see if the outline updates correctly in all cases.
- verify that when dragging layers in and out of groups, the layer panel UI updates correctly to reflect the new location of the layer after dragging.
- duplicating items in a group should behave as expected, currently it wasn't, they were ending up outside the group.
- make sure voting works properly
- moving shapes with arrow buttons seems to be jumping too much, should be 1px per press
- when holding two fingers on trackpad and moving them you should pan the canvas (right now it's just scrolling the page)
- should we have more colors...? allows background to be any color? Allow bg to be either one of the two colors or black or white?
- when i log out and click log in again, I'm not able to select between my google accounts, it just logs in with the last one I used.
- can see wall of the day's submissions - but only after you've submitted something yourself. 
- button hover effects
- i can hover over the days in the calender view and see the day's word in a tooltip, which is ok (use actual tooltip library), but I can also see the words for the upcoming days, which I shouldn't be able to.
