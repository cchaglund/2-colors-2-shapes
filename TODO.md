Features to add:
- decrease zoom amount - it's a bit aggressive right now, you have to be very delicate to get the zoom level you want
- Save feature (database)
- mappable keyboard shortcuts (so users can customize their own - save to db later)
- calendar feature: view past submissions in a calendar layout
- submit button to save current canvas to database (otherwise it's only saved in localStorage)
- modal to explain the app on first load
