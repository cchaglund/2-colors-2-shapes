# To-Do List

- select multiple shapes by dragging a box around them with the mouse
- forms for submitting feedback, reporting bugs, requesting features
- ~~buy domain and set up hosting~~ ✅ 2colors2shapes.com (Loopia + Netlify DNS)
- search for artist by email (hm, privacy implications?)
- should be able to comment on submissions from the "single submission page" (maybe a nightmare?)
- when undoing/redoing, a toast should pop up showing the name of the action that was undone/redone (e.g. "Moved shape", "Changed color", etc.)
- an "eye" icon on the layers panel to toggle visibility of each layer

# Bugs
- bug: när man roterar en hel drös med shapes så verkar de rotera lite olika mängder

- test a bunch of manipulations (scaling, rotating, moving around) to see if the outline updates correctly in all cases.
- verify that when dragging layers in and out of groups, the layer panel UI updates correctly to reflect the new location of the layer after dragging.
- make sure voting works properly
- moving shapes with arrow buttons seems to be jumping too much, should be 1px per press
- when holding two fingers on trackpad and moving them you should pan the canvas (right now it's just scrolling the page)
