- some shape's outlines seems to have a lot of spacing between their outline and the shape itself. 
- test a bunch of manipulations (scaling, rotating, moving around) to see if the outline updates correctly in all cases.
- verify that when dragging layers in and out of groups, the layer panel UI updates correctly to reflect the new location of the layer after dragging.
- duplicating items in a group should behave as expected, currently it wasn't, they were ending up outside the group.
- make sure voting works properly
- moving shapes with arrow buttons seems to be jumping too much, should be 1px per press
- when holding two fingers on trackpad and moving them you should pan the canvas (right now it's just scrolling the page)
- should we have more colors...? allows background to be any color? Allow bg to be either one of the two colors or black or white?
