# To-Do List

- select multiple shapes by dragging a box around them with the mouse
- make it so that you don't open a new tab when you click on a single submission. especially since when you click "back to app" it takes you to the canvas, and the place you were originally is actually in another tab.
- if i got a trophy for a challenge's submission I should get a congratulations message/modal when I load/log in for that day (today I see the challenge's winners, but it's possible to miss that I won, I have to check the list to see if I won. It should be more obvious). should also have confetti animation or something.
- forms for submitting feedback, reporting bugs, requesting features
- buy domain and set up hosting
- do logo
- search for artist by email (hm, privacy implications?)
- should be able to comment on submissions from the "single submission page" (maybe a nightmare?)

# Bugs
- bug: när man roterar en hel drös med shapes så verkar de rotera lite olika mängder

- test a bunch of manipulations (scaling, rotating, moving around) to see if the outline updates correctly in all cases.
- verify that when dragging layers in and out of groups, the layer panel UI updates correctly to reflect the new location of the layer after dragging.
- make sure voting works properly
- moving shapes with arrow buttons seems to be jumping too much, should be 1px per press
- when holding two fingers on trackpad and moving them you should pan the canvas (right now it's just scrolling the page)
