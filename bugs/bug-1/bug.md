i have multiple groups with layers in them. If I duplicate a layer in the group that's at the bottom, then the entire group moves to the top of the layer stack, above all other groups! What should happen is that it should just duplicate the layer within the same group and not move the group at all. The duplicated layer should appear directly above the original layer within the same group, and the order of the groups should remain unchanged.
