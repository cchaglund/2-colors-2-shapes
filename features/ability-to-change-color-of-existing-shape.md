# Feature: ability-to-change-color-of-existing-shape

## Description

The user creates a shape by clicking on the "+" with the desired color (in the Toolbar component). But we would like to be able to change the color of an existing shape after it has been created. This could be done by selecting a shape (clicking on it or its layer in the LayerPanel), and then clicking on a different color in the Toolbar. The selected shape's color should update to the newly selected color. Update the instructions in the Toolbar so the user know this.
