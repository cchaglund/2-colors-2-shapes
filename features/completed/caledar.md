create a calendar view to browse past daily challenges and submissions. I want to be able to see my progress over time and revisit old challenges easily. i want to see a grid layout of days (like a calendar) which shows a thumbnail of my submission for each day i completed. clicking on a day should open a page in a new tab which shows the image in a larger view with options to download or share it (as both a png and svg). that view should also show the date and the shapes/colors used that day. ideally, the calendar should allow me to navigate between months and years to explore my history of submissions. if the user hasn't submitted anything on a given day, that day should be grayed out or show a placeholder indicating no submission.
