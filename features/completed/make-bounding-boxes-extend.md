the blue and black bounding boxes aren't visible when they're outside the 800x800 canvas. It wouldg be great if the bounding boxes could extend beyond the canvas edges, so you can still see and interact with them even when shapes are partially or fully outside the canvas area. This would help with positioning and transforming shapes that are off-canvas.
