# Feature: make-possible-to-duplicate-group

## Description

You can currently duplicate a shape by selecting it and pressing the "c" key. I would like to extend this functionality to allow duplicating entire groups of selected shapes. When multiple shapes are selected (using Shift+click), pressing "c" should create duplicates of all selected shapes, maintaining their relative positions to each other. This would streamline the workflow when working with complex designs that involve multiple elements, allowing for quick replication of grouped shapes. In the same way as duplicating a single shape, when they're duplicated the new shapes should be added by some offset (whatever the current offset is for single shape duplication) so that the user can see the new shapes immediately.
