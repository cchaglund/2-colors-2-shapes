currently you can select a shape, one at a time, by clicking on it or its layer. when it's selected this displays the shapes outline (in dashed black border) and the transformhandles rectangle (blue solid border). I would like to be able to select multiple shapes at once, by holding down the shift key and clicking on additional shapes or their layers. when multiple shapes are selected, the transform handles should encompass all selected shapes, allowing for group transformations like moving, scaling, or rotating them together. the outline should also adjust to show the combined area of all selected shapes. this feature would greatly enhance workflow efficiency when working with complex designs involving multiple elements.
