We have an issue with how we handle submissions and local storage. Currently, when a user loads the app, we check if they have a submission in the database and load that into local storage, overwriting any unsaved changes they may have made locally. This can lead to frustration if a user has made changes but then refreshes the page and loses those changes. If there's something in local storage we should keep that as the source of truth, and only if there's nothing in local storage do we fetch from the db. That way if I've made changes locally those are preserved.

Also, we're not storing the layer data in the database at all right now, only the flattened image. This means that if I log in on a different machine I can't continue working on my layers since only the flattened image is stored. We need to store the layer data (including layer order, groups, names, everything basically) in the database as well so that when I log in on a different machine I can continue working on my layers seamlessly.
