## PRD-001 — canvas-confetti dependency
- Installed canvas-confetti + @types/canvas-confetti
- Typecheck passes, import works
- Files: package.json, package-lock.json

## PRD-002 — useWinnerAnnouncement hook: userPlacement + persistSeen
- Added useMemo-based userPlacement: finds user's entry in topThree by userId match
- Added persistSeen(): same upsert as dismiss() but does NOT setShouldShow(false)
- Key decision: userPlacement is a memo derived from topThree + userId, not separate state. Simpler, auto-updates if topThree changes.
- Tie handling: .find() returns first match — works for ties since all tied entries share the same rank value
- Files: src/hooks/useWinnerAnnouncement.ts
- All feedback loops pass (typecheck, 102 tests, lint)
