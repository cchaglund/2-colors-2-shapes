## REFACTOR-010 — Refactor WinnerCard.tsx to use RANK_COLORS
- Replaced ternary chain of Tailwind `bg-[#hex]` classes with `RANK_COLORS[rank]` lookup
- Switched from Tailwind arbitrary value class to inline `style={{ backgroundColor }}` — dynamic interpolation breaks Tailwind JIT scanning

- CANVAS_SIZE=800 already exported from src/types/canvas.ts; removed 4 local duplicates
- Replaced local `const CANVAS_SIZE = 800` with import in: SubmissionCanvas.tsx, SubmissionThumbnail.tsx, useExportActions.ts, useBackgroundPanning.ts
- PRD said "two files" but found 4 duplicates total (SubmissionCanvas, SubmissionThumbnail, useExportActions, useBackgroundPanning)
- Files changed: src/components/submission/SubmissionCanvas.tsx, src/components/SubmissionThumbnail.tsx, src/hooks/useExportActions.ts, src/hooks/useBackgroundPanning.ts
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.

- Props: onClose, children, size (max-w class), className, closeOnEscape (default true), closeOnBackdropClick (default true), ariaLabelledBy, zIndex
- Backdrop: fixed inset-0, bg-(--color-modal-overlay), flex center, configurable z-index
- Content box: bg-(--color-bg-primary), border, rounded-lg, p-6, configurable max-w via size prop
- Escape key closes modal when closeOnEscape=true
- Backdrop click closes modal when closeOnBackdropClick=true (e.target === e.currentTarget check)
- Focus trap: Tab/Shift+Tab cycles through focusable elements within modal
- Auto-focuses first focusable element on mount
- Accessibility: role="dialog", aria-modal="true", configurable aria-labelledby
- Files changed: src/components/Modal.tsx
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-014 through REFACTOR-022 (refactor each modal to use shared Modal)

## REFACTOR-014 — Refactor OnboardingModal to use shared Modal
- Replaced inline `fixed inset-0 bg-black/50` backdrop + content box with shared `<Modal>`
- OnboardingModal is non-closable (onboarding must be completed): closeOnEscape=false, closeOnBackdropClick=false, onClose=no-op
- Used size="max-w-sm" to match original max-w-sm styling
- Added aria-labelledby="onboarding-title" with matching id on h2
- Files changed: src/components/modals/OnboardingModal.tsx
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-015 (WelcomeModal)

## REFACTOR-015 — Refactor WelcomeModal to use shared Modal
- Replaced inline backdrop div (`fixed inset-0 bg-black/50`) + content box with shared `<Modal>`
- Removed manual escape key handler, focus trap, modalRef, buttonRef — all handled by shared Modal
- Removed `useEffect` and `useRef` imports (no longer needed)
- WelcomeModal reduced from 155 to 99 lines
- Files changed: src/components/modals/WelcomeModal.tsx
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-016 (FriendsModal)

## REFACTOR-016 — Refactor FriendsModal to use shared Modal
- Replaced both render paths (not-logged-in + logged-in) with shared `<Modal>`
- Removed manual escape handler, focus trap, modalRef, handleOverlayClick — all handled by Modal
- Logged-in path uses `className="!p-0 max-h-[80vh] flex flex-col"` to override default padding and add scroll layout
- Not-logged-in path uses default Modal padding (p-6)
- Removed `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useCallback` (handleOverlayClick) imports — only `useCallback` kept for handleNavigateToProfile
- FriendsModal reduced from 161 to 109 lines
- Files changed: src/components/modals/FriendsModal.tsx
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-017 (KeyboardSettingsModal)

## REFACTOR-017 — Refactor KeyboardSettingsModal to use shared Modal
- Replaced outer backdrop div (`fixed inset-0 bg-(--color-modal-overlay)`) + content box with shared `<Modal>`
- Used `className="!p-0 max-h-[80vh] overflow-hidden flex flex-col"` to preserve custom header/content/footer layout
- Set `closeOnEscape={false}` — component has custom 3-level escape logic (cancel listening > dismiss conflicts > close)
- Conflict resolution dialog also uses shared `<Modal>` with `zIndex="z-60"`, `closeOnEscape={false}`, `closeOnBackdropClick={false}`
- Removed `useRef` import (Modal handles its own ref)
- Files changed: src/components/KeyboardSettingsModal.tsx
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.

## REFACTOR-019 — Refactor VotingModal to use shared Modal
- Replaced inline `fixed inset-0 bg-black/50` backdrop + `ref={modalRef}` wrapper with shared `<Modal>`
- Modal content box styled as transparent (`!p-0 !border-0 !bg-transparent !rounded-none`) — child components (VotingPairView, VotingConfirmation, etc.) own their own card styling
- Context-dependent close: `handleClose` switches between `onComplete` (confirmation/opt-in screens) and `onSkipVoting` (voting screen) — passed as `onClose` to Modal
- Removed manual focus trap and escape key handler (30+ lines) — delegated to shared Modal
- Removed `useRef` import (no longer needed)
- Files changed: src/components/voting/VotingModal.tsx
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-020 (CongratulatoryModal)

## REFACTOR-020 — Refactor CongratulatoryModal to use shared Modal

- Main state: default close behavior (escape + backdrop click), `ariaLabelledBy="congrats-title"`
- Removed `modalRef`, `buttonRef`, manual escape handler, focus trap (~30 lines) — delegated to shared Modal
- Confetti logic unchanged (useRef + useEffect for canvas-confetti)
- File reduced from 169 to 119 lines
- Files changed: src/components/modals/CongratulatoryModal.tsx
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-021 (WinnerAnnouncementModal)

## REFACTOR-021 — Refactor WinnerAnnouncementModal to use shared Modal
- Replaced both render paths (loading + main) with shared `<Modal>`
- Loading state: `closeOnBackdropClick={false}` (no accidental dismiss while loading)
- Main state: default close behavior (escape + backdrop click), `ariaLabelledBy="winner-title"`, `size="max-w-140"`
- Removed `modalRef`, `buttonRef`, manual escape handler, focus trap (~25 lines) — delegated to shared Modal
- Removed `useEffect` and `useRef` imports (no longer needed)
- File reduced from 161 to 107 lines
- Files changed: src/components/modals/WinnerAnnouncementModal.tsx
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-022 (LoginPromptModal)

## REFACTOR-022 — Refactor LoginPromptModal to use shared Modal
- Replaced inline `fixed inset-0 bg-(--color-modal-overlay)` backdrop + content box with shared `<Modal>`
- Preserved `z-1000` via zIndex prop, `max-w-84` via size prop, `text-center` via className
- Added `ariaLabelledBy="login-prompt-title"` with matching id on h3
- No manual escape/focus trap to remove — component was simple; gains accessibility features from shared Modal
- File reduced from 65 to 67 lines (added Modal import + aria props)
- Files changed: src/components/LoginPromptModal.tsx
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Phase 2 complete. Next: Phase 3 (REFACTOR-023, useCanvasHistory extraction)

## REFACTOR-023 — Extract useCanvasHistory hook
- Created src/hooks/useCanvasHistory.ts
- Hook manages: history stack (ref), historyIndex/historyLength (state), coalescing (300ms window), max 50 entries
- Exposes: pushHistory(state), commitToHistory(state), undo() → CanvasState|null, redo() → CanvasState|null, canUndo, canRedo, resetHistory(state)
- pushHistory internally checks isUndoRedoRef to suppress during undo/redo — orchestrator doesn't need to check
- commitToHistory skips coalescing check — used after drag operations complete
- undo/redo return restored CanvasState (or null if at boundary); orchestrator applies via setCanvasStateInternal
- resetHistory replaces stack with single entry — used by loadCanvasState
- useCanvasState destructures hook methods for stable useCallback deps (React Compiler requires full object or destructured refs)
- Removed ~50 lines of inline history state/logic from useCanvasState; replaced with hook call + ~15 lines of wiring
- Files changed: src/hooks/useCanvasHistory.ts (new), src/hooks/useCanvasState.ts (refactored)
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-024 (useCanvasStorage extraction)

## REFACTOR-024 — Extract useCanvasStorage hook
- Created src/hooks/useCanvasStorage.ts
- Exports: `getInitialCanvasState()` (pure fn, reads localStorage, returns CanvasState for useState init), `initialCanvasState` (empty default), `useCanvasStorage(canvasState, userId)` hook
- Hook manages: debounced save (300ms) on canvasState changes via useEffect + setTimeout, `saveCanvasStateNow()` for immediate save bypassing debounce
- `getInitialCanvasState()` checks localStorage date matches today, handles groups migration, clears stale data
- Orchestrator uses `saveCanvasStateNow` in `loadCanvasState` for server submission sync (no debounce delay)
- Removed from useCanvasState: STORAGE_KEY, StoredData interface, loadFromStorage, saveToStorage, initialCanvasState, userIdRef, save useEffect (~40 lines)
- Added to useCanvasState: 2 import lines + 1 hook call line
- Files changed: src/hooks/useCanvasStorage.ts (new), src/hooks/useCanvasState.ts (refactored)
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-025 (useShapeOperations extraction)

## REFACTOR-025 — Extract useShapeOperations hook
- Created src/hooks/useShapeOperations.ts
- Hook receives `challenge` and `setCanvasState` (orchestrator's history-aware setter) as args
- Exposes: addShape, duplicateShape, duplicateShapes, updateShape, updateShapes, deleteShape, deleteSelectedShapes, selectShape, moveLayer, moveGroup, reorderLayers, reorderGroup, setBackgroundColor, mirrorHorizontal, mirrorVertical, createGroup, deleteGroup, ungroupShapes, renameGroup, toggleGroupCollapsed, moveToGroup, selectGroup
- normalizeZIndices helper moved as module-level function in useShapeOperations.ts
- Hook doesn't push history directly — calls setCanvasState which orchestrator wired to pushHistory
- Selection ops pass `addToHistory=false`; toggleGroupCollapsed passes `addToHistory=false`
- Orchestrator (useCanvasState.ts) reduced from 1104 to 139 lines; removed generateId import
- Kept in orchestrator: undo/redo, commitToHistory, resetCanvas, getShapesInGroup, loadCanvasState (these coordinate across hooks or need direct state access)
- Files changed: src/hooks/useShapeOperations.ts (new), src/hooks/useCanvasState.ts (refactored)
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-026 (useCanvasState thin orchestrator verification)

## REFACTOR-026 — Verify useCanvasState is a thin orchestrator
- useCanvasState.ts already completed during REFACTOR-023/024/025 incremental extraction
- File is 153 lines (target was <300), composes useCanvasHistory + useCanvasStorage + useShapeOperations
- No inline undo/redo stack logic, no localStorage persistence, no shape CRUD operations remain
- Orchestrator owns canvasState via useState, wraps setCanvasState with history push, delegates all ops
- Atomic ops (group create/delete, duplicate-with-select) handled correctly via setCanvasState wrapper
- Single consumer (App.tsx) unchanged — public API identical
- Files changed: none (verification only, PRD updated)
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-027/028/029 (verify group/mirror/selection ops post-decomposition)

## REFACTOR-027 — Verify group operations post-decomposition
- Code-level verification (visual testing blocked by sandbox firewall — no Supabase access)
- createGroup: useShapeOperations:645-700, generates group ID, assigns groupId to shapes, normalizes z-indices
- deleteGroup: useShapeOperations:702-714, clears groupId from shapes, removes group from groups array
- ungroupShapes: useShapeOperations:716-765, removes groupId, cleans up empty groups, preserves z-order
- renameGroup: useShapeOperations:767-777, updates group name
- moveGroup: useShapeOperations:328-471, handles up/down/top/bottom including group-vs-group swaps
- All ops wired: useShapeOperations → useCanvasState orchestrator → App.tsx → LayerPanel → GroupHeader
- Public API unchanged — no consumer changes needed
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-028 (verify mirror/flip ops) or REFACTOR-029 (verify selection)

## REFACTOR-028 — Verify mirror/flip operations post-decomposition
- Code-level verification (visual testing blocked by sandbox firewall — no Supabase access)
- mirrorHorizontal: useShapeOperations:559-598, single shape toggles flipX, multi-shape reflects across bounding box center + toggles flipX
- mirrorVertical: useShapeOperations:601-641, single shape toggles flipY, multi-shape reflects across center Y + toggles flipY
- Both ops call setCanvasState(updater) → orchestrator pushes to history → undo/redo works
- Wiring: useShapeOperations → useCanvasState → App.tsx → useShapeActions (button clicks) + useCanvasKeyboardShortcuts (key bindings)
- ActionToolbar receives handleMirrorHorizontal/handleMirrorVertical (selection-wrapped)
- Keyboard shortcuts receive raw mirrorHorizontal/mirrorVertical, pass selected shape IDs
- Public API unchanged — no consumer changes needed
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-029 (verify selection management) or REFACTOR-030 (shapeHelpers split)

## REFACTOR-029 — Verify selection management post-decomposition
- Code-level verification (visual testing blocked by sandbox firewall — no Supabase access)
- selectShape: useShapeOperations:188-238, handles single select (new Set([id])), toggle/multi-select (Cmd/Ctrl+click), range select (Shift+click), deselect (id=null → empty Set)
- selectGroup: useShapeOperations:813-842, selects all shapes in group with toggle support
- All selection ops pass addToHistory=false — selection is ephemeral UI state, no undo/redo entries
- Deselection: 3-level — canvas background rect onMouseDown, SVG handleCanvasMouseDown, <main> onClick; stopPropagation prevents double-firing
- Selection persistence: updateShape/updateShapes/moveLayer/mirror ops use {...prev, shapes: ...} spread, preserving selectedShapeIds untouched; shape IDs stable across mutations
- Wiring intact: useShapeOperations → useCanvasState (destructured + re-exported) → App.tsx → Canvas (onSelectShape) + LayerPanel (onSelectShape, onSelectGroup)
- Public API unchanged — no consumer changes needed
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-030 (shapeHelpers split into src/utils/shapes/)

## REFACTOR-030/031/032 — Split shapeHelpers.ts into src/utils/shapes/
- Created src/utils/shapes/ directory with 4 files:
  - polygons.ts: 14 polygon point generators (getPolygonPoints, getStarPoints, getRightTrianglePoints, getIsoscelesTrianglePoints, getDiamondPoints, getTrapezoidPoints, getParallelogramPoints, getKitePoints, getCrossPoints, getArrowPoints, getShardPoints, getWedgePoints, getSplinterPoints, getChunkPoints)
  - paths.ts: 21 path/bezier generators (getSemicirclePath, getQuarterCirclePath, getBladePath, getLensPath, getArchPath, getDropPath, getFanPath, getHookPath, getWavePath, getCrescentPath, getPillPath, getFangPath, getClawPath, getFinPath, getThornPath, getSlantPath, getNotchPath, getSpikePath, getBulgePath, getScoopPath, getRidgePath)
  - utils.ts: SHAPE_ASPECT_RATIOS, getShapeSVGData (imports from polygons/paths), generateId, SHAPE_NAMES
  - index.ts: barrel re-exporting all from polygons, paths, utils
- Updated 8 consumer imports: ChallengeDetailsCard, WinnersDayPage, TransformHandles, ChallengeShapeIndicators, ShapeIcon, ShapeExplorer, SVGShape, useShapeOperations
- Deleted original src/utils/shapeHelpers.ts — zero remaining references
- Files changed: 4 new (shapes/polygons.ts, paths.ts, utils.ts, index.ts), 8 edited (import paths), 1 deleted (shapeHelpers.ts)
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-033 (useAppModals hook extraction from App.tsx)

## REFACTOR-033 — Extract useAppModals hook from App.tsx
- Created src/hooks/useAppModals.ts
- Hook manages 6 modal states: showKeyboardSettings, showVotingModal, showResetConfirm, showFriendsModal, congratsDismissed, winnerDismissed
- Exposes open/close/dismiss callbacks for each (useCallback-wrapped for stable references)
- App.tsx: replaced 6 individual useState calls with single useAppModals() destructure
- App.tsx: replaced all inline `() => setState(...)` callbacks with named functions from hook (openFriendsModal, closeVotingModal, etc.)
- Removed `useState` import from App.tsx (no longer needed)
- Note: useWelcomeModal already its own hook — left as-is
- Files changed: src/hooks/useAppModals.ts (new), src/App.tsx (refactored)
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-034 (route/view resolution extraction from App.tsx)

## REFACTOR-034 — Extract route/view resolution from App.tsx
- Created src/hooks/useAppRoute.ts: resolves URL params into discriminated union `AppRoute` type
- Route types: explorer, voting-test, social-test, dashboard, color-tester, gallery, wall-of-the-day, profile (standalone), winners-day, submission-by-id, submission-by-date, canvas (challenge-dependent)
- Exported `isStandaloneRoute()` type guard to separate routes needing challenge data from those that don't
- Replaced 10 individual `useMemo(() => urlParamFn(), [])` calls with single `useAppRoute()` call
- Extracted canvas editor (hooks, handlers, JSX) into src/components/CanvasEditorPage.tsx (452 lines)
- App.tsx reduced from 519 to 61 lines — thin router that resolves route, loads challenge, and renders appropriate page
- CanvasEditorPage accepts `challenge: DailyChallenge` + `todayDate: string` props; owns all canvas-specific state/hooks
- Removed direct urlParams imports from App.tsx
- Files changed: src/hooks/useAppRoute.ts (new), src/components/CanvasEditorPage.tsx (new), src/App.tsx (rewritten)
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Next: REFACTOR-035 (verify all modals still open/close after decomposition)

## REFACTOR-035 — Verify all modals still open/close after App.tsx decomposition
- Code-level verification: all 8 modal open/close chains traced through useAppModals → CanvasEditorPage → modal components
- Visual browser testing (mock challenge injected via localStorage to bypass sandbox firewall):
  - Welcome modal: opens on first visit (localStorage cleared), closes via "Start creating" button ✓
  - Keyboard settings: opens via Toolbar "Customize" button, closes via "Done" button ✓
  - Reset confirm: opens via "Reset Canvas" button, closes via "Cancel" button ✓
  - Friends modal (not logged in): correctly shows LoginPromptModal via Toolbar's login gate, closes via "Cancel" ✓
  - Friends modal (logged in path): code wiring verified — openFriendsModal → showFriendsModal → FriendsModal onClose=closeFriendsModal
  - Voting modal: code wiring verified — openVotingModal called in onSaveSuccess, closeVotingModal passed as onComplete/onSkipVoting, gated by showVotingModal && user
  - Onboarding modal: code wiring verified — gated by user && profile && !profile.onboarding_complete, onComplete=updateNickname
  - Congratulatory/Winner modals: code wiring verified — useWinnerAnnouncement hook → dismissCongrats/dismissWinner from useAppModals
- No code changes needed — verification only
- Typecheck: pass. Tests: 102 pass. Lint: pre-existing error only.
- Phase 3 complete. Next: Phase 4 (REFACTOR-036, add test identifiers)

## REFACTOR-036 — Add data-testid to SubmissionThumbnail SVG root
- Added `data-testid="submission-thumbnail"` to the `<svg>` element in SubmissionThumbnail.tsx
