## PRD-001 — canvas-confetti dependency
- Installed canvas-confetti + @types/canvas-confetti
- Typecheck passes, import works
- Files: package.json, package-lock.json

## PRD-002 — useWinnerAnnouncement hook: userPlacement + persistSeen
- Added useMemo-based userPlacement: finds user's entry in topThree by userId match
- Added persistSeen(): same upsert as dismiss() but does NOT setShouldShow(false)
- Key decision: userPlacement is a memo derived from topThree + userId, not separate state. Simpler, auto-updates if topThree changes.
- Tie handling: .find() returns first match — works for ties since all tied entries share the same rank value
- Files: src/hooks/useWinnerAnnouncement.ts
- All feedback loops pass (typecheck, 102 tests, lint)

## PRD-003 — CongratulatoryModal component
- Created src/components/modals/CongratulatoryModal.tsx
- Props: userEntry (RankingEntry), challengeDate (string), onDismiss callback
- Fetches challenge internally via useDailyChallenge(challengeDate), shows spinner while loading
- Rank-specific heading/subtext: 1st="You won!"/"1st place — Congratulations!", 2nd="2nd Place!"/"Congratulations!", 3rd="3rd Place!"/"Congratulations!"
- Renders user submission via WinnerCard with size="lg"
- Dismiss button reads "Yay!", calls onDismiss
- Follows exact same modal patterns as WinnerAnnouncementModal (overlay, card, focus trap, Escape, aria)
- Files: src/components/modals/CongratulatoryModal.tsx
- All feedback loops pass (typecheck, 102 tests, lint)

## PRD-004 — Styling & Accessibility
- Already fully implemented in PRD-003: overlay, card, focus trap, Escape, aria attrs, aria-labelledby, auto-focus all match WinnerAnnouncementModal exactly
- Verified line-by-line against WinnerAnnouncementModal — identical patterns
- No code changes needed, just marking as passing
- All feedback loops pass (typecheck, 102 tests, lint)
