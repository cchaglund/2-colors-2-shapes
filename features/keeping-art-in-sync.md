# Feature: keeping-art-in-sync

## Description

If I have an account and I've submitted an artwork, if I subsequently log in on another machine please load the submission into local storage. we want the experience to be seamless across devices, and it would be wrong to show something different on the 2nd local machine compared to what's been submitted. If we load the submitted version on the new machine the user can continue iterating and then update it later. If there is already something in local storage we overwrite it.
