# Feature: sidebar-toggling

## Description

You should be able to close the sidebars (toolbar and layer panel) to have more canvas space (obviously you should be able to re-open them too). Should be able to resize them as well (drag on the edge to resize). Save this in localstorage so it persists across sessions. When closed, there should be a small tab or button to re-open them. This would help users focus on the canvas when needed, especially on smaller screens.
