## PRD Item: Database (1/12)
- Created 009_likes.sql migration
- likes table: id, user_id, submission_id, created_at, unique(user_id, submission_id)
- RLS: public select, auth insert/delete own
- FK: submission_id REFERENCES submissions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- Added like_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0 to submissions
- Triggers: increment on INSERT to likes, decrement on DELETE
- Index: submissions(challenge_date, like_count DESC, created_at ASC) for wall sorting
- Migration pushed to remote (supabase db push --include-all)
- Typecheck: pass, Tests: 112 pass, Lint: pre-existing errors (unrelated to my changes)
- Files: supabase/migrations/009_likes.sql

Note: Local supabase start fails due to missing initial submissions table migration.
Remote DB has full schema; local migrations incomplete. Not blocking remote development.
