## PRD Item: Database (1/12)
- Created 009_likes.sql migration
- likes table: id, user_id, submission_id, created_at, unique(user_id, submission_id)
- RLS: public select, auth insert/delete own
- FK: submission_id REFERENCES submissions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- Added like_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0 to submissions
- Triggers: increment on INSERT to likes, decrement on DELETE
- Index: submissions(challenge_date, like_count DESC, created_at ASC) for wall sorting
- Migration pushed to remote (supabase db push --include-all)
- Typecheck: pass, Tests: 112 pass, Lint: pre-existing errors (unrelated to my changes)
- Files: supabase/migrations/009_likes.sql

Note: Local supabase start fails due to missing initial submissions table migration.
Remote DB has full schema; local migrations incomplete. Not blocking remote development.

## PRD Item: Database - Verify Production (2/12)
- Verified likes table exists via Supabase JS client query
- Verified submissions.like_count column exists
- Migration 009_likes.sql confirmed on production
- Triggers verified via migration SQL review (SECURITY DEFINER functions)
- Files: none changed (verification only)

## PRD Items: Like Button on Submission Detail (3-8/14)
Implemented 6 PRD items in single commit (tightly coupled):
- Like Button Display: heart icon, outlined/filled states, disabled during mutation
- Like Button Disabled for Own: disabled + tooltip "You can't like your own work"
- Like/Unlike Action: toggle, optimistic UI, DB persistence, rollback on error
- Like Count Display: 0=no count, 1+=show count, >9999="9999+"
- Tooltip: "Like"/"Unlike" based on state, "Sign in to like" for logged out
- Accessibility: aria-pressed, aria-label, focus ring, keyboard support

Note: Toast for errors not impl (no toast system exists). Errors logged to console.
Click-to-login for logged out users deferred to Authentication PRD item.
